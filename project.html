                            Ethiopia has a significant need for school feeding programs to address widespread hunger and
                            malnutrition among schoolchildren, particularly those from low-income families, which can
                            impact their health, education, and development. School feeding programs are seen as a crucial
                            component of a holistic approach to improving child well-being and promoting social equity.
                            Additionally, Ethiopian government has recently initiated the school feeding program at
                            primary schools only. The need for the feeding program for secondary public schools
                            particularly in Addis Ababa is very high since it is an overlooked area in which students coming
                            from low income families have not get meals in order to support their education. NGOs are not
                            also focused on supporting these secondary schools in the capital but dedicated their support
                            at other regions. Hence, the need to expand the program to other public secondary schools
                            across the capital as well as initiating the feeding program has become all time high.

                            Creating an income generation project for vulnerable mothers can empower them economically
                            and socially.
                            Our objective is to provide vulnerable mothers with skills, resources, and opportunities to
                            generate sustainable income.
                            The target group includes single mothers, low-income families, and those facing socio
                            economic challenges at Woreda 07 Yeka Sub City. The selection has been conducted jointly with
                            Yeka Sub Cities Woreda 07 Women and Children Office.
                            We have conducted mini assessments and focus group discussions to identify the specific
                            needs, skills, and interests of the target group. We have also assessed local market demands to
                            align the project with viable income-generating activities.
                            We have also conducted skills training by Woreda Job and Skills Expert: Offer workshops in
                            various areas such as:
                            • Spice Production and Selling
                            • Food production
                            • Financial literacy (budgeting, saving)
                            We have provided materials and tools needed for the chosen income-generating activities. Each
                            mother has received a total of 10,000 ETB for start up and running capitals. The IGA group has
                            also established an SHG group called Hibret and started to save with the minimum set amount.
                            This income generation project aims not only to provide financial independence but also to
                            build confidence and community among vulnerable mothers. By equipping them with skills and
                            resources, we can foster resilience and improve their overall quality of life.

                            Eneho Fikir has been implementing a project at 13 targeted secondary schools to improve
                            student outcomes. The project delivers encouraging results, particularly in the teachers
                            training, students training, exposure visits, advocacy weeks on mental wellness, and goal
                            setting for high school students. In addition, the project encourages best preforming students
                            through supporting them with supplementary books and certificate of appreciation. On the
                            other hand, among the best performing students, there are vulnerable students who are
                            currently pursuing their education under difficult circumstances. The vulnerable students are
                            also comes from low income families and displaced from other regions due to the ongoing
                            conflicts. Accordingly, we have conducted a preliminary assessment on the situation of
                            vulnerable students to support them based on their need and the school administration has
                            also provided recommendations to assist those who are under difficult positions to continue
                            their education.
                            The targeted schools serve a diverse student population with a significant percentage coming
                            from low-income families. The school has identified challenges in supporting students facing
                            such as food insecurity, lack of scholastic materials, housing instability, trauma, and lack of
                            access to healthcare, etc.

                            Eneho Fikire has a strong ambition in supporting vulnerable girls to improve their education
                            outcomes. For its realisation, we have been amplifying girl’s education to ensure girls at schools
                            should receive the necessary support and excel in academic performance.
                            We have identified 153 female students who are enrolled in to our feeding program at
                            Tesfaberhan S.School. These female students were mentored by a teacher while they received
                            their daily meals. This is to ensure their school attendance and better academic performances.
                            Girls in schools have faced different challenges that can negatively influence their education.
                            Among the challenges school girls face include lack of scholastic materials and dignity kits.
                            Hence, we have provided sanitary pads to these girls so that they can properly continue their
                            education.
                            These girls who are also enrolled in to the school feeding program have been receiving sanitary
                            pads as a means to continue their education that can potentially happen due to menstruation.

                            Our Emergency Support Project is essential for providing immediate assistance to vulnerable
                            populations during crises, such as natural disasters, health emergencies, or economic
                            downturns.
                            Our objective is to provide immediate relief and support to vulnerable individuals and families
                            during emergencies, ensuring their basic needs are met and facilitating recovery.
                            The target group includes low-income families, single parents, the elderly, individuals with
                            disabilities, and other marginalized groups affected by emergencies which are residing at Yeka
                            Sub City.
                            We have collaborated with local authorities and organizations to gather data on the most
                            urgent requirements (food, clothing, medical care, etc.).
                            We have distributed essential items such as clothing, and other materials for needy target
                            groups. The donations items were donated by ET Foundation and Individual collaborators who
                            are willing to support.
                            The Emergency Support Project aims to provide timely and effective assistance to those in need
                            during crises. By addressing immediate needs while also laying the groundwork for recovery
                            and resilience, this project can help vulnerable populations navigate challenging times and
                            emerge stronger.

                            Eneho Fikir, in collaboration with CPAR, is successfully implementing a project aimed at
                            commemorating the victims of ET 302 by empowering high school students in Addis Ababa,
                            Ethiopia. The initiative focuses on 11 high schools selected from different sub cities within
                            Addis Ababa. This project is initiated and funded by Transport Canada as one of the
                            commemorative projects to make a meaningful impact in youth focused, community based,
                            environmental and humanitarian perspectives.
                            Eneho Fiker has launched the joint project with CPAR aimed at expanding its impact on the
                            educational and social support for vulnerable students. Building upon the success of the first
                            phase, this continuation emphasizes sustainable development through education, nutrition and
                            skill building, various motivational as well as psycho social; support activities. The phase two
                            continues to focus on holistic approach to enhance the project outcomes.
                            Furthermore, On March 10, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 crashed right after taking off
                            from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, near Addis Ababa Ethiopia claiming the lives of
                            157 people including 18 Canadians and many others with ties to Canada. On the fourth
                            anniversary of the tragic accident, the ministry of transport announced that the government of
                            Canada is providing financial support for commemorative project to honor and preserve the
                            memory of the victims of the flight ET 302 in a long lasting visible and meaningful way.
                            Hence, Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief (CPAR) took the leading responsibility to work on
                            disadvantaged high school students in Addis Ababa Ethiopia in areas of youth education, career
                            development, social development sexual and reproductive health awareness, environmental
                            awareness, and stewardship and humanitarian activities as well as several school gardening
                            projects.
                            In the implementation of the commemorative project, CPAR entered a sub grantee agreement
                            with Eneho Fikir to carry out identified activities on motivational and social and career
                            development endeavors in the selected 11 high schools in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. Eneho Fiker is
                            granted a lead role in the implementation of the following activities per the sub grantee

                            campaigns for at least two times in a year. The campaign was conducted jointly with Paulos
                            Hospital, Ethiopian Dental association and GIV Society at targeted schools. During the campaign
                            volunteer Doctors form Paulos Hospital diagnosed and treated students, teachers and the
                            surrounding community. Meantime, needy students and teachers received with eyeglasses and
                            other referral medications.
                            Furthermore, the medical campaigns provided a wide range of free medical services [dental,
                            ophthalmology, dermatology, cervical cancer, etc.] for school children and the surrounding
                            community. The event also helps school children for disease prevention through referral
                            treatment and on spot treatment for minor medical cases. This kind of medical campaign has
                            played its own role in improving education outcomes at the targeted school.
